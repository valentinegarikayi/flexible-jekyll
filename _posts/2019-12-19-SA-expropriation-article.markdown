I wrote this article during the campaign period of South Africa's 2019 general election. At the time, land expropriation without compensation was a burning issue. Since President Ramaphosa's election into office in May 2019 it seems the matter has fizzled off. Nevertheless, the issues I pointed out during the time remain highly relevant to this day.
